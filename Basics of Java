Java is WORA - write once run anywhere

Flow of execution -->  write the code in .java file -> goes to java compiler(java c) where it is converted to byte code -> after conversion to bytecode it is .class file -> it goes to JVM , the jvm looks for main method 
which is a particular method signature -> JVM runs it using JRE which provides an enviroment having extra libraries. 

JVM and JRE are on top of your OS and hardware

Jshell -> is java shell that can be run on cmd , it produces one line output

To do any action in java we need methods
