Threads are the smallest unit and multiple threads can be run together.

Sure! Here's a **very small and simple intro on Threads**:

---

### ðŸ”¹ What are Threads?

A **Thread** is the smallest unit of a process that can run independently. Threads help run multiple tasks **at the same time (concurrently)** in Java. Useful in automation when we want parallel test execution.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Java Thread Program (for QA Interview):

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start(); // starts the thread
    }
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Key Points for Interview:

* Use `.start()` to begin a thread (not `.run()` directly).
* `extends Thread` is one way; another is `implements Runnable`.
* Helps in **parallel testing** or **faster execution**.

Would you like a quick example with `Runnable` too?
