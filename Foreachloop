### Benefits of `for-each` Loop over Traditional `for` Loop:

1. **Simplified Syntax**: The `for-each` loop provides a more concise and readable way to iterate through collections and arrays.
2. **Reduced Errors**: It minimizes the risk of errors related to index manipulation, such as off-by-one errors.
3. **Ease of Use**: Ideal for iterating through all elements when the index is not needed.
