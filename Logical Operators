example

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int a = 5;
        int b = 7;
        int c = 8;
        int d = 12;
        
        //and operator
        boolean result = a > b && c<d;
        System.out.println(result);
        
        //nor operator
        boolean result2 = a<b || c<d;
        System.out.println(result2);
        
        //not operator
        System.out.println(!result2);
        
        
        
    }
}

can use more than one expression to compare such as 
boolean result = a > b && c<d && c>1;
boolean result = a > b && c<d || c>1;



Truth table of AND, OR, NOT operator

AND (A AND B)
True only if both A and B are true.
OR (A OR B)
True if at least one of A or B is true.
NOT (NOT A, NOT B)
Inverts the value:
If A is true → NOT A is false.
If A is false → NOT A is true.


OR operator is like a short circuit if we want to check for true values 
AND operator is like a short circuit if we want to check for false values
