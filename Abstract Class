An abstract method in Java is a method that is declared without an implementation. It has no body and must be implemented by a subclass. Abstract methods are declared using the abstract keyword in an abstract class. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be extended by other classes.

Explanation:
Abstract Class: A class that contains at least one abstract method.
Abstract Method: A method without a body (implementation). Subclasses must override it.


// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    abstract void makeSound();

    // Regular method
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Providing implementation for the abstract method
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark! Bark!");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Polymorphism
        myDog.makeSound();        // Calls the abstract method's implementation
        myDog.eat();              // Calls the regular method
    }
}
